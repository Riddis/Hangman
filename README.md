## The Mission

I created a hangman game in Python, that is played in the terminal.

## Steps

- **What is the game about ?**

  The [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting a letter.

In this implementation, we will **NOT** have the drawing of the man being hanged. We will just have the word with the letters appearing as more and more letters are guessed correctly.

You can play the game by running 'python main.py' in a terminal located in \Repo_Folder\Hangman
No additional module installation is required. 
I took 2 hours to complete the project.
